Objective;

Create a simple, responsive, eye-pleasing product page for an imagined e-commerce store. Include a simple header (no need for account management buttons or anything like that, unless you feel like it) and the detailed product section. The site, named Aeolian, is geared towards 30 - 60 year old professional women. It sells high-end blow dryers to salon owners and individuals who really appreciate a good blow dryer.
